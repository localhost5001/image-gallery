# Mastermind Full Stack Developer Interview Exercise

First off, thank you for taking the time to do this exercise. We find that doing a contained development exercise like this one is much more effective than an in-person technical interview. No matter what our hiring decision is, we will make sure that you receive a complete code review for the work you deliver.

Be sure to carefully review this README before cloning the repository and getting started. It contains important setup instructions and lays out our expectations for how the final web app you build should work.

### What is the goal of this exercise?

The topics covered by this project are the basics of full stack web development. Completing this exercise will prepare you for working at Mastermind. Having a decent knowledge on these topics will allow you to easily join the team and learn new skills faster.

### Basic topics / skills covered by this exercise

- Version control (git)
- API interactions
- Javascript / Typescript
- React frontend
- Node (Express) backend
- SQL databases
- Layout & style implementation

## What are you going to build?

We would like you to build a photo search website. Don't worry, it's quite simple. Here is a mockup of what we would like to see, [available on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/wOUpro9PbQVJCd2capMz4j/Mastermind-Web-Exercise).

- This boilerplate repository should serve as your starting point for this exercise. Included here is a PostgreSQL database that includes ~100 photos to be displayed on this website.
- In this web application, photos are categorized into "Collections". Users will search photos by selecting a specific Collection and searching within that collection via keywords. For example, someone might want to find mountain photos around Vancouver. They can type in "Vancouver" and select the "Mountains" collection from the dropdown.
- You will need to build the backend API which exposes the photos in the postgres database to your frontend. You will find 3 tables in the database: photo, collection, and photographer. Each photo belongs to a single collection and photographer. You can review the “schema.sql” file to see the exact structure of these 3 tables.
- After a successful search, the user should be displayed a page with a masonry grid of search results. Refer to designs to see how this page should look like.
- When a user clicks on any photo in the results page, it should open a modal which will display the full photo, details about its photographer, and a download button.

### Design

Transforming complex designs to HTML & CSS in a seamless and accessible way is a critical skill for being a part of the team at Mastermind. Your final implementation will be reviewed against the provided design comp. You need to create a [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) account. Once you do, you can extract assets and review designs from [the web exercise Figma board](https://www.figma.com/file/wOUpro9PbQVJCd2capMz4j/Mastermind-Web-Exercise).

### Timing

You should complete this exercise within 72 hours of receiving it. Applicants who do not complete this exercise will not be accepted to the position.

### Deliverable

You should publish your work to your own git repository that our team can review. You should invite maziar@mastermind.co and cameron@mastermind.co to have access this repository. We should be able to clone your repository and run the application using the same setup instructions provided below.

### Questions?

If you are stuck at some point, or if you have questions about the scope, we are always here to help you. Please don't hesitate to email Maziar: maziar@mastermind.co.

### Bonus points

Additional features and improvements on the basic requirements are welcome. A few ideas:

- You can cache the results of a particular search. Then, if a search with the same keyword is used again, the app could get the cached results without making another request to the API.
- There’s no design for a “no result” case for the search list. You may display something that you think fits the design language.
- Make the website responsive and suitable for mobile devices: Building responsive sites is a time-consuming task, so this is only a bonus feature, but it will go a long way towards proving your CSS skills if you are able to deliver a responsive implementation.
- Update the README file to explain the changes you made and the reasoning for them.
- Deploy this web app to a cloud-based server
- Add unit tests

# Setup

Now you are ready to get going! We have provided this repository as a starting point for your work. We believe that this will prevent wasted time configuring your environment and instead allow you to showcase your full-stack capabilities within an existing system. This project uses `docker-compose` to run a React frontend, Express / Node API, and PostgreSQL database. Before starting, fork this repository and ensure you have up-to-date `docker` and `docker-compose` installed.

To run the project locally, you can use a single command from the root of the project:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This may take a while on the first run as the `postgres` and `node` docker images are downloaded.

Once you see logs from the `postgres` service saying "database system is ready to accept connections", you will need to import the database schema and records:

```bash
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d photos -f /migration/migration.sql
```

This command will initialize your database with pre-populated `photo`, `collection`, and `photographer` tables.

## Running locally

After the initial setup above, you can run the local environment at any time with:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Both the `api` and `web` servers will automatically restart as you make code changes.

# Codebase structure

You will need to work within the `web` and `api` subdirectories of this repo.

### web

The `web` directory contains a template React frontend using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) with TypeScript enabled. No changes have been made to the default CRA setup, so see their documentation for how to go about making changes. Once started, the web server is accessible from `http://localhost:3000`

### api

The `api` directory has a boilerplate Express server written in TypeScript. The server is set up to get a Postgres connection and then listen at `http://localhost:8080`. We have provided an existing Postgres connection, but feel free switch to a different package for interacting with the database.

# Installing npm packages

You may install any packages that will help you on the front or back end. However, note that we may ask you about your dependency decisions in the follow-up interview, so be prepared to justify your choices.

To install packages, you **cannot** run `yarn` or `npm` commands directly. These commands must be run through docker while you have the containers running:

```bash
docker-compose exec api yarn add _______
```

or

```bash
docker-compose exec web yarn add _______
```
